# Performance Model Test Applications

## Introduction

Collection of small programs to test performance models for parallel applications.
Programs are run as regular MPI applications.

## Requirements
* C and C++11 compiler
* MPI runtime
* gengetopt
* make (optional)

## List of Test Applications
### AmdahlApp
Synthetic test simulating compute bound applications.

### StreamApp
Synthetic test simulating memory bound applications.
